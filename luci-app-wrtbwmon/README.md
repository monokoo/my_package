# luci-app-wrtbwmon

The origin codes come from Kiougar https://github.com/Kiougar/luci-wrtbwmon.

This repository modified the codes which makes it just like the structures of some other Luci packages. Besides, this version just identifies the hosts by the unique MAC rather than the IP by modified the demaon of wrtbwmon https://github.com/brvphoenix/wrtbwmon. Thus, if you want to use this version, you must also use the modified wrtbwmon at the same time.
